## Stack

| Layer | Technology |
|-------|-----------|
| Framework | React 18 + TypeScript |
| Build | Vite 6 |
| UI | shadcn/ui (Radix primitives) |
| Styling | Tailwind CSS v4 |
| Theme | 10 themes (5 light + 5 dark) — see Settings |
| Streaming | `fetch` + `ReadableStream` (POST-based SSE) |
| Notifications | Sonner |

## Architecture

### Theme

The app supports 10 color themes, managed by `ThemeContext` with localStorage persistence:

- **Light:** Ayu Light, Catppuccin Latte (default), Everforest Light, Rosé Pine Dawn, Solarized Light
- **Dark:** Ayu Dark, Catppuccin Mocha, Dracula, Nord, Tokyo Night

Theme and timezone preferences are configured on the Settings page. Colors are mapped to shadcn CSS variables in `src/index.css` using CSS class selectors per theme.

### Persona-Based Navigation

The sidebar provides access to persona-based workflows:

| Persona | Icon | Description |
|---------|------|-------------|
| **Platform Catalog** | BookOpen | Browse agents, memory resources, MCP servers, A2A agents (default) |
| **Agents** | Bot | Deploy new agents or import existing ones |
| **Memory** | Brain | Create and manage AgentCore Memory resources |
| **Security Admin** | Shield | Manage IAM roles, authorizer configs, credentials, permission requests |
| **MCP Servers** | Network | Register and manage MCP servers with OAuth2 auth, tool discovery, and access control |
| **A2A Agents** | Users | Register and manage A2A agents with OAuth2 auth, Agent Card display, and access control |
| **Registry** | Library | Browse and manage AWS Agent Registry records for governance and discovery |
| **Tags** | Tags | Manage tag policies and tag profiles with collapsible groups and JSON import |
| **Costs** | DollarSign | Cost dashboard with estimated costs, actual runtime costs from CloudWatch, and cost settings |
| **Settings** | Settings | Manage display preferences (theme, timezone), cost estimation settings (CPU I/O wait discount), and Agent Registry configuration (ARN-based, opt-in governance) |
| **Admin Dashboard** | BarChart3 | Platform usage analytics with custom tooltips on all charts, login tracking, action tracking, page navigation, per-session drill-down (super-admins only) |

**End-user chat layout:** Users in the `t-user` Cognito group (without `t-admin`) see a dedicated `ChatPage` instead of the admin sidebar. The chat layout provides a focused chat interface with agent selection, conversation history with immediate tab creation on `session_start`, streaming responses scoped to the active conversation, queued prompt support (single-slot, last-write-wins, auto-sends on stream completion), markdown rendering for all bubbles (user, assistant, queued) with collapsible JSON blocks, and a memory panel — with no admin navigation items exposed.

The admin sidebar includes a View As dropdown (Eye icon) to preview specific user experiences including end-users (`demo-user-*`, `test-user`). Selecting an end-user persona switches to the `ChatPage` layout so admins can verify the end-user experience. A banner indicates the preview mode. Theme and timezone are configured on the Settings page. Each listing page has a card/table view toggle; the selection persists per-page across persona switches.

### Drill-Down Navigation

Within the Catalog persona, state-driven drill-down:

```
Catalog → Agent Detail → Session Detail
```

No router library — view selection is based on `selectedAgentId` and `selectedSessionId` state in `App.tsx`.

### Authentication

When Cognito is configured, users must sign in before accessing the app. Configuration requires:
- **Backend:** `LOOM_COGNITO_USER_POOL_ID` in `backend/etc/environment.sh`
- **Frontend:** `VITE_COGNITO_USER_CLIENT_ID` in `frontend/.env`

The login page handles the `USER_PASSWORD_AUTH` flow and `NEW_PASSWORD_REQUIRED` challenge. Tokens are stored in memory only (not persisted across page reloads). The access token is automatically attached to all API requests. The `.env` file is the standard Vite mechanism for environment variables — any variable prefixed with `VITE_` is exposed via `import.meta.env`.

The `AuthContext` also generates a `browserSessionId` (UUID via `crypto.randomUUID()`) on login, stored in React state only (resets on page refresh). This is used for audit tracking — all login, action, and page view events include this session ID so that multiple users sharing the same Cognito account can be distinguished by session. A `recordLogin` event is fired automatically on successful authentication.

The `AuthContext` also provides scope-based authorization using a two-dimensional group architecture. User groups are extracted from the `cognito:groups` claim in the ID token and mapped to 19 scopes via `GROUP_SCOPES` (matching the backend mapping exactly). Type groups (`t-admin`, `t-user`) determine UI layout; resource groups (`g-admins-*`, `g-users-*`) determine access. Key groups: `g-admins-super` (all scopes), `g-admins-demo` (read/write to most pages including MCP and A2A), `g-admins-security`, `g-admins-memory`, `g-admins-mcp`, `g-admins-a2a`, `g-users-demo/test/strategics` (invoke + group-filtered read). Sidebar items are conditionally rendered based on scopes, and write operations are disabled via a `readOnly` prop for users without the corresponding `*:write` scope. When auth is not configured, all scopes are granted.

### API Layer

- `api/client.ts` — `apiFetch<T>()` wrapper with `ApiError` class, automatic auth token injection, and 401 auto-refresh (transparent token refresh and request retry)
- `api/auth.ts` — Cognito auth API: `fetchAuthConfig`, `initiateAuth`, `respondToNewPasswordChallenge`, `refreshTokens`
- `api/agents.ts` — Agent operations: list, get, register (with optional model_id), deploy, delete (with optional AWS cleanup), refresh, redeploy, fetchRoles, fetchCognitoPools, fetchModels, fetchDefaults
- `api/invocations.ts` — Session queries + `invokeAgentStream()` SSE consumer (supports `credential_id`, includes auth header)
- `api/logs.ts` — CloudWatch log queries with cache-busting refresh support
- `api/memories.ts` — Memory resource operations: create, import, list, get, refresh, delete, purge
- `api/security.ts` — Security admin operations: managed roles, authorizer configs, authorizer credentials, permission requests
- `api/a2a.ts` — A2A agent operations: CRUD, test connection, card retrieval/refresh, skills, access rules
- `api/mcp.ts` — MCP server operations: CRUD, test connection, tool discovery/refresh, access rule management
- `api/settings.ts` — Tag policy and tag profile operations: list, create, update, delete
- `api/costs.ts` — Cost dashboard API: `fetchCostDashboard` (estimated costs), `fetchCostActuals` (actual runtime + memory costs from CloudWatch logs), `fetchModelPricing`
- `api/traces.ts` — Trace API: `getSessionTraces` (list traces for a session), `getTraceDetail` (full trace with spans)
- `api/registry.ts` — Registry operations: list records, get record, create record, submit/approve/reject, delete, search
- `api/types.ts` — TypeScript interfaces including AgentResponse (with `model_id`, `tags`), SSESessionStart (with `has_token`, `token_source`), AuthorizerCredential, ManagedRole, PermissionRequestResponse, MemoryResponse (with `tags`), MemoryCreateRequest (with `tags`), MemoryStrategyRequest, McpServer, McpTool, McpServerAccess, TagPolicy, TagPolicyCreateRequest, TagPolicyUpdateRequest, TagProfile, TagProfileCreateRequest

### Hooks

- `useAgents()` — Agent list with auto-fetch, CRUD actions, register (with optional modelId), async deletion polling (DELETING → 404 → purge)
- `useSessions(agentId)` — Session list that re-fetches on agent change
- `useInvoke(authorizerName?)` — Streaming state management with module-level store (survives component unmount/remount), `AbortController` for cancellation, supports credential_id and bearer_token, provides friendly error messages with authorizer-specific hints. `clearInvokeState()` preserves the subscriber set so the component stays subscribed across "New Conversation" resets.
- `useLogs()` — On-demand session log fetching with `noCache` support for cache-busting refresh, vended log source management, stream log retrieval
- `useTraces()` — Trace list and detail state management with lazy loading
- `useA2aAgents()` — A2A agent list with auto-fetch, CRUD callbacks, toast notifications
- `useMcpServers()` — MCP server list with auto-fetch, CRUD callbacks, toast notifications
- `useRegistry()` — Registry records with status/type filtering and semantic search
- `useDeployment()` — Agent config, credential providers, and integrations

### Key Components

- **SearchableSelect** — Combobox with search, filter, optional group headers (Anthropic/Amazon), and click-outside detection. Searches both label and value fields.
- **AgentCard** — Compact card with two-row header layout, inline badges (including authorizer display), refresh button, Trash2 icon for deletion, overlay confirmation with "Also delete in AgentCore" checkbox. Supports transitional status display (deploying → completing deployment → finalizing endpoint → deleting) with spinner and elapsed timer. Deletion with AWS cleanup shows DELETING state with timer using `deleteStartTime` prop. Displays tag badges for tags marked `show_on_card` in the tag policy.
- **MemoryCard** — Memory resource card with name, status badge, spinner+timer for transitional states (using per-resource timestamps for accurate elapsed time), region/account/expiry metadata, tag badges, refresh and delete buttons with overlay confirmation.
- **JsonConfigSection** — Shared collapsible JSON import/export section used by both agent deploy and memory create forms. Encapsulates toggle, monospace textarea, and Apply/Export/Cancel buttons. Export produces human-readable JSON that is round-trip compatible with import.
- **ResourceTagFields** — Shared component for tag profile selection and tag resolution. Fetches tag policies and profiles, renders a profile dropdown (persisted in `sessionStorage`), resolves tags from the selected profile + policy defaults. Used by both agent deploy and memory create forms.
- **MultiSelect** — Checkbox-based multi-select dropdown with auto-expanding width. Used for tag filtering on all listing pages.
- **InvokePanel** — Qualifier selector, context-aware credential dropdown (OAuth agents: user token / M2M / manual token; non-OAuth: SigV4 only), model ID badge, prompt textarea, invoke/cancel buttons. Auto-selects newly created session. Token indicator shown when invocation uses OAuth.
- **AuthorizerManagementPanel** — Lists authorizer configs with expandable credential management (add/list/delete credentials per config).
- **McpServerForm** — Create/edit form for MCP servers with transport selector (SSE, Streamable HTTP), progressive OAuth2 disclosure (auth_type toggle reveals client ID, secret, token URL, scopes, well-known URL fields), and test connection button in edit mode.
- **McpToolList** — Displays discovered tools for a server with refresh button, collapsible JSON schema display per tool, and empty state guidance.
- **McpAccessControl** — Per-persona access toggle with all_tools/selected_tools radio and individual tool checkboxes. Deny-by-default — personas have no access until explicitly granted.
- **A2aAgentForm** — Create/edit form for A2A agents with base URL input, progressive OAuth2 disclosure, and test connection button.
- **A2aAgentCardView** — Structured Agent Card display: capabilities, authentication schemes, input/output modes, and skills.
- **A2aAccessControl** — Per-persona access control for A2A agent skills with all_skills/selected_skills modes.
- **MemoryManagementPanel** — Create/import form with JSON import/export and strategy configuration (type, name, description, namespace), memory card/table list with status badges (CREATING/ACTIVE/FAILED/DELETING), refresh and delete actions with inline confirmation overlay.
- **LogViewer** — Paginated CloudWatch log display (200 lines/page) with toggleable line numbers and timestamps, log stream selector with timezone-aware timestamps, vended log source selector (runtime APPLICATION_LOGS, runtime USAGE_LOGS, memory APPLICATION_LOGS), and cache-busting refresh support.
- **TraceList** — Trace summary table with columns: Trace ID, Start Time, End Time, Duration, Spans, Events. Clickable rows to select a trace for detailed view.
- **TraceGraph** — Interactive CSS waterfall timeline showing span durations relative to trace start. 8-color palette for span differentiation. Persistent hover detail panel (Span ID, Scope, Duration, Events, Start/End). Left panel: span list with divide styling. Right panel: per-span events with expand/collapse all toggle. Event detail lines: timestamp, span ID link, scope/source.

### Session Liveness

Session liveness is computed server-side using `LOOM_SESSION_IDLE_TIMEOUT_SECONDS` (default 300). The frontend displays:
- **Active session count** on each agent card — cold-start indicator (0 = next invoke is cold)
- **Live status badges** on sessions — color-coded: active (green), expired (muted), streaming/pending (yellow), error (red)

## Deployment

For cloud deployment to ECS Fargate, see the [root README](../README.md). The `frontend/.env` file is auto-populated by running `cd shared && make outputs` after deploying infrastructure stacks.

## Configuration

The frontend connects to the backend at the URL specified by `VITE_API_BASE_URL` (defaults to `http://localhost:8000` for local dev). For cloud deployments behind an ALB with path-based routing, `VITE_API_BASE_URL` should be empty string (same-origin). The client uses nullish coalescing (`??`) so empty string is preserved. The backend CORS configuration allows requests from `http://localhost:5173` and any additional origins specified in `LOOM_ALLOWED_ORIGINS`.

To change the dev server port:

```bash
make dev FRONTEND_PORT=3000
```

## Build

```bash
make build
```

Output is written to `dist/`. Serve with `make preview` or any static file server.

## Container Deployment

A multi-stage Dockerfile is provided for building a production container image:

```bash
# Build for cloud deployment (same-origin API via ALB path routing)
podman build --platform linux/amd64 \
  --build-arg VITE_COGNITO_USER_CLIENT_ID=<client-id> \
  -t loom-frontend .

# Run locally
podman run -p 80:80 loom-frontend
```

The container uses nginx to serve static assets with SPA routing (`try_files` fallback to `index.html`), gzip compression, and immutable cache headers for versioned assets.
